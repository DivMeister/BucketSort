# BucketSort
This repo is java code that replicates the Bubble Sort mobile game. 

## Description:
This code was used in the Java module to create a game called Water Sort. In this game, random colours are stored in Lists and the user has to sort these colours by using push or pop methods. The game is completed when all Lists are filled with the same colours.

### Why it changed my perspective on IT:
This showed me how powerfull code can be and what could be done when writing your own code.
